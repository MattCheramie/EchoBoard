# EchoBoard Roadmap 🗺️

This roadmap turns the vision in [`README.md`](./README.md) into an executable delivery
plan. Work is organized into **tiers**. Each tier is a coherent slice of the product and
is delivered through several **staged pull requests (PRs)**. Each PR is broken into
several **commits** so history stays readable and reviewable.

> **Working agreement**
> - **Tier** → a milestone-sized band of functionality.
> - **PR** → a reviewable, independently mergeable unit inside a tier.
> - **Commit** → a single logical step inside a PR.
> - `main` must stay green after every PR. Feature work happens on
>   `claude/<topic>` branches and merges via PR.
> - Later tiers assume earlier tiers are merged; PRs inside a tier are ordered but
>   may overlap where dependencies allow.

## Tier 0 — Foundation & Scaffolding 🚧

**Goal:** Establish the repository skeleton, tooling, and this roadmap so every later
tier has a place to plug in. Skeleton-only — structure and stubs, no runnable features
yet. Monorepo (`backend/` + `frontend/`) with the single-binary embed path pre-wired.

### PR 0.1 — Roadmap + monorepo scaffolding 🚧
Goal: Lay down docs, directory structure, module/config/CI stubs.
Deliverables: `ROADMAP.md`, monorepo skeleton, single-binary embed scaffold, CI stubs.
Commits:
- `docs: add ROADMAP.md tiered delivery plan`
- `chore: add root project scaffolding (.gitignore, .editorconfig, .env.example, Makefile)`
- `chore(backend): initialize Go module and internal package skeleton`
- `chore(backend): scaffold single-binary frontend embed`
- `chore(frontend): scaffold SvelteKit + Tailwind config and stub landing page`
- `ci: add backend/frontend CI stubs and PR template`
- `docs: add CONTRIBUTING and ARCHITECTURE, refresh README getting-started`
